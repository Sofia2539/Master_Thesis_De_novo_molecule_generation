# De Novo Exploration of Kinase Inhibitors
This repository contains the necessary files, datasets, and generated molecules used in my thesis on the de novo exploration of kinase inhibitors. The research was conducted using the REINVENT 3.2 tool, aimed at exploring novel chemical space for kinase inhibitor discovery.

# Repository Contents
+ **Datasets:** Contains the datasets used in the research as input data (Curated datasets for eight different kinase targets - ABL1, AKT1, AurA, BRAF, CDK2, CK1, MEK1, PIM1 - Each dataset includes SMILES strings of molecules that are potential ligands for the respective kinase target)
+ **Generated Molecules:** Includes the molecules generated and evaluated during the process.
+ **Scripts:** Contains Python scripts used for data preparation, analysis, and some shell scripts for automation tasks.
+ **Models:** Contains the two Random Forest Classifiers used as predictive models components in the scoring fucntion of the Reinforcement Learning setup.
