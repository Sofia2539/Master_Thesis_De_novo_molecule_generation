# De Novo Exploration of Kinase Inhibitors
This repository contains the files, datasets, models, and generated molecules from my Master's thesis research on _de novo _ exploration of kinase inhibitors. The work was conducted using **REINVENT 3.2**, aiming to explore novel chemical space for the discovery of potential kinase inhibitors.

# Repository Contents
+ **Datasets:** Contains the datasets used in the research as input data (Curated datasets for eight different kinase targets - ABL1, AKT1, AurA, BRAF, CDK2, CK1, MEK1, PIM1 - Each dataset includes SMILES strings of molecules that are potential ligands for the respective kinase target)
+ **Generated Molecules:** Includes the molecules generated and evaluated during the process.
+ **Scripts:** Contains Python scripts used for data preparation, analysis, and some shell scripts for automation tasks.
+ **Models:** Contains the two Random Forest Classifiers used as predictive models components in the scoring fucntion of the Reinforcement Learning setup.
